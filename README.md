# Payment Manager Serverless Application

This is a serverless application using the AWS ecosystem and the Serverless Framework that processes events from S3 and SQS, transforms the data, and stores the results in a DynamoDB.

### Deployment

In order to deploy the application, you need to run the following command:

```
$ serverless deploy
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\",\n  \"input\": {}\n}"
}
```
